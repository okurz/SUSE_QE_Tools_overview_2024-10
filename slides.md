### Impediments and requirements

#### Impediments to the roadmap

<small>

* More products, more users, more instances: We suffer from our own success :)
* Hardware-related administration work hinders software development

</small>


#### Resource requirements

<small>

* Additional redundancy for O3 PPC
* Rest of workers needing replacement (nearly all current hardware out of maintenance)
* SSD storage for O3 would improve user experience
* Increase number of CPU cores for OSD VM
